# Flight Booking Application
This is an student project to practice working with databases. It is in **python** uses **sqlite**.

I was the team leader in this project and while managing my team consisting of two other students, I also coded some of the main parts of application and prepared one of the documents.

### db scripts
Includes two scripts for creating sqlite database and populating it with random data. This database corresponds to a Airport.

### docs
There are two documents in Farsi, one documenting database structure/schema. Other documents demonstrates key features of application.

### src
Includes 9 python scripts and a png picture. These python modules form different parts of the application.

## Running the application
First create and populate a database by running scripts in **db scripts** directory. Now move the database in the same folder as application code files (**src** here) and execute the application by running **main.py**.
