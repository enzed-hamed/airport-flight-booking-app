# Ticket Reserve System
This is a python student project application for buying tickets. It makes use of databases.

I was the team leader in this project and while managing 3 other students, I also coded some of the main parts of application and wrote one of the documents.

### db scripts
Includes two scripts for creating sqlite database and populating it with random data. This database corresponds to a Airport.

### docs
There are two documents in Farsi, one documenting database structure/schema. Other documents demonstrates key features of application.

### src
Includes 9 python scripts and a png picture. These python modules form different parts of the application.

## Running application
First create and populate a database by running scripts in `db scripts` directory. Now move the database in the same folder as application code files (`src` here) and execute the application by running `main.py`.
